JMRI on Windows: "The JAVA SE Platform binary has stopped working" error
</H1>

This page discusses what to do when your Windows machine displays a 
"The JAVA SE Platform binary has stopped working" error
message when starting JMRI.

<p>
This seems to happen only on Windows, and only in particular situations.
We don't understand exactly when.
<p>
(Should we add more info here on which Windows versions, etc?  
Does that matter if somebody has hit the error)
<p>
The problem seems to involve the USB connection to 
layout hardware.

<ol>
<li>If you have your layout connected through USB,
try connecting via a powered hub.
<li>If you're already using a powered hub, try connecting
directly to the computer. 
</ol>

You may have to reset preferences after each change of the wiring.
